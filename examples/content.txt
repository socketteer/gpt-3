This is a short story: 
Once upon a time in Amsterdam, there was a boy who couldn't speak. He wanted to speak, but nothing came out.

His mind was thinking, but his voice was silent. There was a lot going on around him that he wanted to say. He sat on a bench, reading a newspaper. He could read, but not speak. He was thinking about the headlines, but he couldn't voice his thoughts. He wanted to speak, but nothing came out.

One day, he decided to go to the doctor. He told the doctor that he felt like a truck had run him over and he was dying to speak. The doctor asked if he could write down what he wanted to say. He wrote down, "I would like to tell you that something is very wrong inside of me."

The doctor asked him, "What else is wrong?" He wrote, "I feel like I'm freezing up inside myself, and I can no longer communicate with the people that I love. "

The doctor told him, "I can help you because you have a rare condition. You're suffering from the ice-cream syndrome. You get too much frozen yogurt in your system, and you lose your ability to speak."

The doctor went on to explain that it's a very rare condition, and not too many people have it. "I think that you are suffering from a rare case of frozen yogurt. "

The doctor walked over to the refrigerator and took out a container of frozen yogurt. He held it up and asked the boy, "What do you think this is?" The boy wrote, "Yoghurt" and started laughing.

"That's right. Do you see how easy that was? Now, I'm going to hold this up to your mouth and tell you to say, 'The frozen yogurt is very good.' You're going to open your mouth and say it." The doctor held the yogurt up to the boy's mouth and said, "Say it, open your mouth and say it. The frozen yogurt is very good. Say it, say it." The doctor put the yogurt toward the boy's mouth, but the boy didn't say a word. The doctor said, "Open your mouth and say it. It's very good frozen yogurt, say it. Open your mouth and say it. "

The boy shook his head no. The doctor asked him, "Why are you shaking your head no?" The boy wrote, "Because I'm not going to say it until I know it's very good frozen yogurt."

The doctor threw the container of frozen yogurt in the trashcan and told the boy, "Your problem is not a rare condition anymore. You're going to be able to speak." He sent him to a speech therapist who helped him overcome the frozen yogurt syndrome. 

This is a true story. It's based on a real short story about a boy who really couldn't speak. It's a true story because it really happened to a boy who was really trying to speak. But he couldn't speak. He wanted to speak, but nothing came out. He started to write things down to let the people know that he was thinking.
